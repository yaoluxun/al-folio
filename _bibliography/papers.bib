  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

Increasing evidence has depicted the correlation between serous ovarian carcinoma prognosis and immune signature. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop a robust prognostic immune-related gene pairs (IRGPs) signature for estimating overall survival (OS) of HGSOC. Methods: Gene expression profiling and clinical information of serous ovarian carcinoma patients were derived from three public data sets, divided into training and validation cohorts. Immune genes significantly associated with prognosis were selected. Results: Among 1,534 immune genes, a 20 IRGPs signature was built which was significantly associated with OS in the training cohort (P=1.44×10-14; hazard ratio [HR] =3.05 [2.26, 4.10]). In the validation datasets, the IRGPs signature significantly divided patients into high- vs low- risk groups considering their prognosis (P=4.30×10-3; HR =1.48 [1.13, 1.95]) and was prognostic in multivariate analysis. Functional analysis showed that several biological processes, including EMT and TGF-β related pathways, enriched in the high-risk group. Macrophages M2 was significantly higher in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. Conclusion: We successfully constructed a robust IRGPs signature with prognostic values for serous ovarian carcinoma, providing new insights into post-operational treatment strategies.}, journal={OncoTargets and Therapy}, author={Zhang, Liuyan and Zhu, Ping and Tong, Yao and Wang, Yuzhuo and Ma, Haifen and Xia, Xuefei and Zhou, Yu and Zhang, Xingguo and Gao, Feng and Shu, Peng}, year={2019}, pages={7005–7014} }

However, the genetic basis of the mammalian DNA replication timing program is poorly understood              1–3              . To systematically identify genetic regulators of DNA replication timing, we exploited inter-individual variation in 457 human pluripotent stem cell lines from 349 individuals. We show that the human genome’s replication program is broadly encoded in DNA and identify 1,617              cis              -acting replication timing quantitative trait loci (rtQTLs              4              ) – base-pair-resolution sequence determinants of replication initiation. rtQTLs function individually, or in combinations of proximal and distal regulators, to affect replication timing. Analysis of rtQTL locations reveals a histone code for replication initiation, composed of bivalent histone H3 trimethylation marks on a background of histone hyperacetylation. The H3 trimethylation marks are individually repressive yet synergize to promote early replication. We further identify novel positive and negative regulators of DNA replication timing, the former comprised of pluripotency-related transcription factors while the latter involve boundary elements. Human replication timing is controlled by a multi-layered mechanism that operates on target DNA sequences, is composed of dozens of effectors working combinatorially, and follows principles analogous to transcription regulation: a histone code, activators and repressors, and a promoter-enhancer logic.}, institution={Genomics}, author={Ding, Qiliang and Edwards, Matthew M. and Hulke, Michelle L. and Bracci, Alexa N. and Hu, Ya and Tong, Yao and Zhu, Xiang and Hsiao, Joyce and Charvet, Christine J. and Ghosh, Sulagna and et al.}, year={2020}, month={May} }

@article{Liu_Tong_Wang_2020, title={Genome-wide detection of short tandem repeat expansions by long-read sequencing}, volume={21}, ISSN={1471-2105}, DOI={10.1186/s12859-020-03876-w}, abstractNote={Abstract                              Background                Short tandem repeat (STR), or “microsatellite”, is a tract of DNA in which a specific motif (typically < 10 base pairs) is repeated multiple times. STRs are abundant throughout the human genome, and specific repeat expansions may be associated with human diseases. Long-read sequencing coupled with bioinformatics tools enables the estimation of repeat counts for STRs. However, with the exception of a few well-known disease-relevant STRs, normal ranges of repeat counts for most STRs in human populations are not well known, preventing the prioritization of STRs that may be associated with human diseases.                                            Results                                  In this study, we extend a computational tool RepeatHMM to infer normal ranges of 432,604 STRs using 21 long-read sequencing datasets on human genomes, and build a genomic-scale database called RepeatHMM-DB with normal repeat ranges for these STRs. Evaluation on 13 well-known repeats show that the inferred repeat ranges provide good estimation to repeat ranges reported in literature from population-scale studies. This database, together with a repeat expansion estimation tool such as RepeatHMM, enables genomic-scale scanning of repeat regions in newly sequenced genomes to identify disease-relevant repeat expansions. As a case study of using RepeatHMM-DB, we evaluate the CAG repeats of                  ATXN3                  for 20 patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) and 5 unaffected individuals, and correctly classify each individual.                                                            Conclusions                                  In summary, RepeatHMM-DB can facilitate prioritization and identification of disease-relevant STRs from whole-genome long-read sequencing data on patients with undiagnosed diseases.
