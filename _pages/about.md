I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the [Graduate School of Public Health](https://publichealth.pitt.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, University of Pittsburgh.

Aspiring biostatistician with strong multidisciplinary academic background and 3-year research experience in **computational genetics and genomics**. Thriving as a team player and independent contributor. 

I spend my lifetime in Shaoxing, Beijing, Ithaca, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. Adventurer, lone ranger, libertarian.

Here is my [résumé](../assets/pdf/YaoTong_resume_TA.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

[comment]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
